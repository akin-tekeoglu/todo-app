# Todo app

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate similarities and differences between languages/frameworks. As you may know, we have too many choices just for creating a simple web app these days. [Having too many choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice#:~:text=Overchoice%20or%20choice%20overload%20is,his%201970%20book%2C%20Future%20Shock.) is actually a problem rather than advantage. To solve this problem, I started to implement a simple web app with different tech stacks so we can at least have an idea of how different languages/frameworks approaches the same problem. Sqllite3 is selected as the persistence layer because of easiness and the storage part is not included in this research because, in my opinion, it deserves another repository just for itself
